# A set of Objective-C classes that helps manipulating Western Musical Scales and Chords.

- Access the most commonly used chords and scales  
- Easy to add your own scales and chords via Ruby 
- Uses ARC



# Quick Start:

Copy all the files in the WMLib folder to your project and  `#import "WMPool.h"` where needed.

The ***WMPool*** is a singleton instance that provides the most commonly used Western Chords and  Scales.  
You can add your own scales and chords using the Ruby facilities provided. (see the wiki for details <https://github.com/fredericcormier/WesternMusicElements/wiki/Ruby-Scripts>)

You can ask for notes:  
`gSharp5 = [[WMPool pool]noteWithRoot:@"g" accidental:@"#" octave:5];`  
`c1 = [[WMPool pool]noteWithRoot:@"g" accidental:nil octave:1];`  

or more simply:  
`[[WMPool pool]noteWithShortName:@"c1"]`

You can also ask for *"Note Collections"*, that is , scales and chords, even inverted:   
 
`fSharp2Mixolydian = [[WMPool pool] scaleWithRoot:@"f" accidental:@"#" octave:2 scaleMode:WMScaleModeMixolydian];` 
 
`C3MajorChordInv2 = [[WMPool pool] chordWithRootShortName:@"C3" chordType:WMChordTypeMajor inversion:WMChordInversionSecond];`




The easiest calls are the one using ***"root note short names"*** like:  
`[[WMPool pool] chordWithRootShortName:@"C3" chordType:WMChordTypeMajor inversion:WMChordInversionRootPosition];`  

(Check the `WMPool.h`for what's in store)

##Note Short Name  
Root short names are formed of:

1. The note name
2. The accidental
3. The octave
 
The note name is written in "Letter Notation" and is not case sensitive.

The accidental, if any, is a "Sharp" noted "#". "Flat" is not supported. No accidental == natural.

Octaves are in the range of -1 to 9

Example of ***valid Note short names***:
`E-1` `F#-1` `C#8` `G5`

##Note Range

**WMPool** will provide notes in the range of:

- Notes: `C-1 to G9`
- Hertz: `8.176 to 12543.85`
- Midi Note Number: `0 to 127`

Of course, each **WMNote** embed that information, as well as the `cpspch` value used by programs like CSound.
